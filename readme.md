# Chess System

This project is a functional chess game developed using Java and thinking in review and consolidate my backend development skills such as the Programing Logic, Object-Oriented Programing, Abstraction and Analysis for choose an architeture schema and interligate all the implementations.
All the chess rules are implamented by many mathosds into the project, highlighting the validation of the moves and the check and checkmate logic.
I developed this system thinking of running it only locally in the terminal.
The list of concepts worked on here is long, but I want to highlight the extense use of matrix of diferents types and the application of the concepts of OOP.
